## Assignment Overview/Purpose

In many ways this reading continues to build upon the question of the opening week thread -- What is tech writing anyway? -- and on the Hart-Davidson reading on the work patterns of tech comm.

In their article, [Natasha Jones](https://wrac.msu.edu/faculty/natasha-jones/) makes the argument that tech writing is a space for advocacy, specifically a space in which to advocate for diversity, inclusion and equity within the human experience.

Jones's article also lays some ground work for the project we will be to undertake Week 3. In this project, I am going to ask you to become an advocate -- via the work of technical communication -- for those students most often at the margins and in need of support within in the Pierce College community. I'll have more to say about this in a bit, but for know let's consider what Jones's work contributes to our developing understanding of technical writing.

## What is an annotation?

In this context, an annotation is a note made in the margins of the texts we will read together. These marginal notes will be used to identify important points and ideas, pose and answer questions, make connections to our experiences and other knowledge, and to have conversations with the reading.

## What should I annotate?

In relation to our discussion work, annotations might be in any of the following areas:

+ Identify an important idea or point in the reading. In your annotation -- say why you think this is important.
+ Identify a place in the reading where you have a question. In your annotation -- pose your question and offer an initial attempt at an answer.
+ Identify a point in the reading where you can make a connection to something -- this might be another reading or something in your own experience.
+ Respond to someone else's annotation. Engage another reader in conversation about something they have annotated. For example, if someone poses a question you might have some into possible answers/perspectives.

## How Many Annotations Should I Add?

This will vary from reading to reading I imagine, but let's use this as a guide:

+ Each student contributes at least 3 original annotations to the text and works to spread their annotations out over the whole reading.
+ Additionally, each student responds to at least 2 annotations originally made by a peer.

## Hypothes.is Help

When you click on the link below to open the reading, you'll find some support documentation (or a "How To" on using Hypothes.is). Use this example of tech writing to help you get started.
