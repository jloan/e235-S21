# DESCRIPTION

Welcome to English 235 (Technical Writing). I'm glad you're here, and I hope the past year has gone as well as possible for you. This course offers students the opportunity for hands-on experience in the diverse range of communications and composing processes that tend to be common to 21st Century technical communication.

Let's talk some course logistics. Our class this quarter is asynchronous, so that means we don't have any required Zoom sessions as a class. That said, I would like to connect with each of you for one-on-one meetings at various points in the quarter and I am happy to meet with anytime to troubleshoot course work or even just to have a conversation. To help facilitate this I've set-up some evening office hours on Tuesdays and Thursday from 6PM to 7PM, and a morning slot on Wednesdays from 10AM - 11AM. During these times you can drop into my Zoom Meeting Space or connect with me on Skype (253-964-6312). If you can't make these times, no worries, just email me (jloan@pierce.etc.edu) and we can set something up at a time that works for you. My quarters are busy, but flexible, so don't hesitate to schedule something with me. I'm sure we can find a good time.

*There are no required textbooks for this course.* Any readings or materials will be provided or are available freely online.

## MY APPROACH

My tech writing course is informed by a handful of perspectives. Broadly, the course is designed to align with the Society for Technical Communication's [definition](https://www.stc.org/about-stc/defining-technical-communication/) of technical writing:

>Technical communication is a broad field and includes any form of communication that exhibits one or more of the following characteristics:
+ Communicating about technical or specialized topics, such as computer applications, medical procedures, or environmental regulations.
+ Communicating by using technology, such as web pages, help files, or social media sites.
+ Providing instructions about how to do something, regardless of how technical the task is or even if technology is used to create or distribute that communication.

More specifically, this course also aligns with the work of Technical Communication scholars like [William Hart-Davidson](https://wrac.msu.edu/faculty/william-hart-davidson/) and [Natasha N. Jones](https://wrac.msu.edu/faculty/natasha-jones/), both of whom we will read this quarter. Hart-Davidson has identified the work patterns of technical communicators to be focused within three areas: 1) information design; 2) user advocacy; and 3) organizational writing stewardship. Jones's work also focuses on the technical writer as advocate with a particular emphasis on the role social justice plays in the work of technical communication.

# COURSE PROJECT

Our work this quarter will extend from a single, multi-part project. This project will be to contribute to a repository of technical communication resources that seeks to advance Pierce College's mission of becoming a more equitable and socially just institution. Generally your work on this project will unfold over three phases -- 1) research and proposing a contribution, 2) prototyping/drafting your contribution, 3) revising your contribution and reporting out on project status. We'll discuss this project and the various phases in more detail as we head into Week 3 and after we've had a chance to do a little introductory work in the course.

# OUTCOMES

Our course project will unfold over multiple genres of technical writing and is designed to support these outcomes:

1.	Identify the purpose of, gather appropriate and accurate information for, and write technical reports for specific audiences (Ex: resume, claim letter, instructions assignment, investigative report, proposal, feasibility report).
2.	Acquire the skills of Information Competency: be able to access, evaluate, and apply information appropriately.
3.	Transform instructions into informational units set down in a numbered sequence that is in logical order, in both writing and illustrations.
4.	Analyze the accuracy of and use appropriately graphics in technical documents.
5.	Write at least three different analytical reports implementing the appropriate content and format for each.
6.	Complete a collaborative team report.
7.	Identify and articulate ethical and multicultural issues in technical writing.


# ASSESSMENT

Our class will conduct assessment using a process of self-reflection and evaluation. My intention in using this process is to offer each of us a chance to experience composing and learning not as a strictly finite task that is either already mastered or simply needs to be mastered, but instead as an ongoing act of inquiry, dialogue, invention, risk taking, concern for others, and, yes, even failure. Conventional grading requires us to over-simplify the otherwise complex processes of learning, processes that require from us a commitment to experimentation, to ambiguity, to taking risks, to listening and responding. Our assessment process will not focus on assigning letter or number grades to individual projects or assignments. This means that while activities, compositions and projects will receive feedback both from me and from your peers, they will not be assigned grades in the traditional sense.

## DETERMINING FINAL GRADES

In addition to getting feedback on your project work, at least three times this quarter you will be asked to compose a self-reflection and assessment that articulates what you are learning. Part of this feedback and self-assessment process will involve considering how learning and labor translates into grades. If a students completes all the assigned work for the course, and reflects/acts on the feedback offered when necessary, they can expect to receive at least a B in the class.

I know that this assessment involves a high degree of trust. You trusting me, and me trusting you. My promise to you is that if you compete all of the assigned work, I will follow the lead of your self-assessment in determining final grades for the course.

# WORKLOAD

One of the most important things to know about this course is that *we'll opt for care in every instance*. If the workload becomes too much, or we're jugging more than we should, then we'll evaluate what will work best to get us towards our outcomes as we go. I've planned for the maximum in advance, under he assumption that our plans and schedule may change. Flexibility is a good, and totally fine.

I suggest dedicating an average of 2 - 3 hours of labor each week to your work in this course. To frame expectations and hopefully decrease overwork, each week I'll both give as much lead time as possible and offer you a sense of how much labor you might devote to a particular phase of our work. I'll communicate course progress via "Weekly Overviews" on Canvas (~1 - 10) to give you a "to-do" list for that week. I will also take a flexible approach to deadlines. Adhering to dealines can help you manage your workload, but you are free to submit work both early or even after a deadline has passed. I take this approach partly because online makes time weird for us all, and focusing on anything is a struggle during a pandemic.

Of course, 2 - 3 hours a week is only a guideline. You may find that you need (or want) more or less time depending on the activity, your preferences, what you can manage during a given week of life and online learning, and your own familiarity with the concepts and processes involved in the course. (I've adapted this *workload* language from the excellent work of [Jentry Sayers](https://github.com/jentery/engl425/blob/main/425spring2021.pdf).


# BASIC NEEDS SECURITY

Any student who faces challenges securing their food or housing and believes this may affect their performance in the course is urged to notify me if you are comfortable in doing so. This will enable me to provide any resources that I may possess. A starting point for support will be to help put you in touch with the [Pierce Advocacy and Resource Connections](https://pierce.ctc.edu/help).

# DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

My goal is to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, and ability).

Creating this environment also includes my commitment to value the diversity of our language practices. School for many is often a place where judgements about language have been harnessed both intentionally and unintentionally to marginalize people and their communities and to set-up barriers to power and success. The composition classroom is a place where we can come to more critically understand how language plays a role in issues of inclusion/exclusion and power in the world.

I (like many of us) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something is said in class (by me or anyone) that raises concerns for you, please talk to me about it.

# ACCESSIBILITY AND SUPPORT RESOURCES

From Access and Disability Services (ADS) to Multicultural Services to Tutoring, a variety of support services exist at Pierce College. Students in need of additional support for any reason should seek out the appropriate services so you can make necessary arrangements. If you are not sure where to go or who to seek out please speak with me so I can help you get where you want to go. If I do not know the answer to a question I will always be more than happy to help you find out who does have an answer.

A good starting point is the [Support Services page](https://www.pierce.ctc.edu/support-services) on the Pierce College website.

Again, do not hesitate to have a conversation with me about support and services. Your success is important to me and I’m willing to help you find what you need.

# NON-DISCRIMINATION

Pierce College is committed to creating quality educational opportunities for a diverse community of learners. Pierce does not discriminate against its students or employees based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability, or sexual orientation in this class we will strive to maintain an open atmosphere with shared respect for all differences.
