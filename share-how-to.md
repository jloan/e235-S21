## Overview

In addition to submitting your "How To" to the assignments area on Canvas, please share your draft to this thread.

Our purposes for sharing these is to begin to establish a collective, somewhat public sense of the ways we are working on things and the choices we are making in our writing.

## Reflecting on Your Work

In relation to your "How To" draft, reflect on the following questions in this space:

+ What is the purpose of your writing? Describe, as specifically as you can, how the choices you made in composing your "How To" extend from this purpose.
+ Who is the audience for your writing? Again, describe as specifically as you can, how the choices you made in composing your "How To" extend from this sense of your audience.
+ I determined the *genre* for your work in asking you to write a "How To." Consider -- what *conventions* of "How To" writing have you picked up from looking at examples of the genre (either ones I provided or some you found yourself) and how did you use them in your own work? Also, Why did you choose the medium/format you did? For example, if you made a slide deck or a video -- why these mediums/formats? How does your choice of medium work in conjunction with your sense of purpose and audience?

Questions of purpose seem straight forward and often are, but it's worth considering the specificities and nuances of purpose as these will impact the choices we make as writers. For example, in ["How to Shred NYC on a Single Speed, Politely"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDCr6-1ORhQ) the purpose could simply be stated as "instruct people on how to ride a bike on the streets of NYC"; however, that might be an over simplification. Another way to state the purpose might be - "to instruct people on how to ride on the streets of NYC *and* to provide potential riders with a sense that they don't have to be a hardcore, hipster bike nerd to be a cyclist in NYC." The difference between these articulations of purpose might seem subtle, but each actually will prompt the writer to make different choices in their approach to their writing.

Audience also often seems a straight forward idea. In school in particular your audience is often simply, and narrowly, the teacher. It is also common to frame audience quite broadly as "anyone interested in my topic." But, again, it's worth thinking about specificity. For example, what level of expertise or prior knowledge do the writers of ["How to Cook Beans in the Rancho Manner"](https://www.ranchogordo.com/blogs/recipes/cooking-basic-beans-in-the-rancho-gordo-manner) or ["How to Make a Zine: A Beginner's Guide"](https://bookriot.com/how-to-make-a-zine/) assume of their audience?

In thinking about genre and medium, a challenge of this class and of technical writing in general I think, is that it requires you to make a variety choices -- based on concepts like *purpose* and *audience*. These choices can feel risky and uncertain, particularly if our experiences as writers has been limited to the genre of academic writing and writing primarily for teachers. A big part of what we will practice in this course is how to navigate these choices, and to reflect on them as a primary site of learning. I want to stress that product a "perfect" product is not the goal for any assignment. Traditional designations like "A" or but to engage in a process of decisions about our work that will set us on the path of our writing fulfilling its purposes and meeting the needs of its audiences.

## Responding to Peers

I am going to ask you to respond to at least 1 peer in this thread. The goal and purpose of this respond is *not* to try to correct or fix their drafts. Ideally, what you want to do is to actually try out their "How To" if that's possible, and you can use your experience of trying it out to initiate some conversation about the draft. More importantly, I think, is to engage the writer's answers/thinking in response to the questions of purpose, audience, and genre/medium. Let's begin to explore these concepts together.

## Timeline for this Thread

I'll set the deadline on Canvas for Monday, April 19. By this date have your "How To" draft shared and the questions answered. By Wednesday, April 21 will be the deadline for responding to at least 1 peer.
