# Weekly Overviews

"Weekly Overviews" on Canvas (~1 - 10) to give you a "to-do" list for the and communicate the progression of the course. I will also take a flexible approach to deadlines. Adhering to dealines can help you manage your workload, but you are free to submit work both early or even after a deadline has passed. I take this approach partly because online makes time weird for us all, and focusing on anything is a struggle during a pandemic.

## Week 1

I anticipate that this week's work will take approximately 1 - 2 hours of labor. Again, this is only an estimate, and you may end up taking or needing more or less time this week given your particular situation.

### To-Do:

+ Read over the course syllabus. It's on Canvas, and here is a version you can comment on. Feel free to ask questions and share thoughts.
+ Participate in a couple of discussion boards -- "Introduce yourself..." and "What is Technical Writing Anyway?"
+ Read and annotate William Hart-Davidson's "What Are the Work Patterns of Technical Communication?"

## Week 2

I anticipate that this week's work will take approximately 2 - 3 hours of labor. Again, this is only an estimate, and you may end up taking or needing more or less time this week given your particular situation.

### To-Do:

+ Read and annotate Natasha N Jones's "The Technical Communicator as Advocate: Integrating a Social Justice Approach in Technical Communication" (2016)
+ "Each One, Teach One" -- Compose a "How-To" 

## On deadlines and late work

As I say in the syllabus I generally have a flexible approach to deadlines. For me this means that deadlines are important because they help us manage our workloads by giving us a time to accomplish a task so that we can move on to the next phase of our work. Meeting deadlines also helps those that we are working with do their work -- like give us feedback, etc. --  in a timely manner. So I encourage you to stay as close to the deadlines as you can in your work. That said, no one should lose sleep in this class because because you finish something a day or two "late" and not at 11:59pm the night before. If you feel that you are going to need more than a day or two past a deadline to complete something, please email me to let me know and so that I can offer whatever assistance I can.

## Office Hours and Scheduling Appointments

Perhaps the best way to get clarification on assignments and feedback on your work -- as well as to get a better sense of who I am as you teacher -- is to drop into office hours or schedule a time to have a chat. I find that even a 5 - 10 minute conversation during a busy day can do a lot to put students at ease in what they are doing. Don't hesitate to reach out.
