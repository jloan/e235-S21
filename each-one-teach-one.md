## Assignment Overview/Purpose

Perhaps the most common form of technical communication is the "How-To," or what will often be called "support documentation." This is a genre of writing that outlines the instructions or procedures for accomplishing a task. So as our first foray into the field of technical communication, we are going to compose one. This introductory project will also give us a chance to begin exploring some of the key concepts and process of the course -- primarily making compositional choices based on questions of *purpose*, *audience*, and *genre*.

## Process

1. Select a process or task that you are familiar with and that requires multiple steps. For example, maybe you know how to make the perfect pot of rice. Or, you are familiar with how to replace the chain on a bicycle.

2. Compose an instruction set ("How To") for the process/task you select that can be delivered via a digital file -- slide deck, Word doc, video (.mov or .m4v), PDF, a web page (HTML), etc. The delivery medium and format is up to you, but your instruction set should contain some combination of both images and words.

3. In addition to submitting your file to the assignment area on Canvas, share your "How To" to the Each One Teach One thread. There will also be a few questions there for you to reflect on in relation to your work.

## Examples

Examples of How To texts are everywhere. Simply do a web search of "how to" and you'll get plenty.

Here are a couple of examples I dig:

+ ["How to Make a Zine: A Beginners Guide"](https://bookriot.com/how-to-make-a-zine/)
+ ["How to Shred New York City on a Fixed Gear, Politely"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDCr6-1ORhQ)
+ ["How to Cook Beans in the Rancho Gordo Manner"](https://www.ranchogordo.com/blogs/recipes/cooking-basic-beans-in-the-rancho-gordo-manner)

Here's a "How To" I composed for a course recently. It needs some revision, but feel free to check it out:

+ ["Modifying a Poetry Program"](https://vimeo.com/409837835)

**IMPORTANT!**

Examples are just that - examples. Writing, even technical writing, isn't about one exact way, or one right answer. It's about *conventions*. For example, consider -- what do all of the examples I link to above have in common? Since they are all a part of the "How To" [genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre), each of these texts, despite their differences, are going have things in common. That's how we recognize as readers that we're looking at a "How To."  

**SUPER IMPORTANT!!**

Technical writing is also about asking questions of *purpose*, *audience*, and *genre*. The three main questions you always want to ask as a writer, technical or otherwise, are:

+ What is my purpose?
+ Who is my audience?
+ What [genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre) am I working in, and what tend to be the *conventions* or expectations for that genre? (For example: What do readers typically need/want/expect from "How To" texts?)

If you can answer these questions, even tentatively, you're off to a good start in whatever you're working on.

## Is There a Rubric?

I am wary of rubrics for the reasons I outline above, so at his point I want to encourage you to follow the "process/guidelines" I've offered and take seriously the questions about purpose, audience, and genre. Additionally, consult the examples I provide and others that you might find helpful and compelling. Once you have draft and share it, we'll have a chance to talk about it. There is no failure for trying. Learning happens in the processes of doing and then reflecting on what you did. See the "Assessment" portion of the syllabus.

Another thing to keep in mind in composing your "How To" -- The Society of Technical Communication [defines technical communication](https://www.stc.org/about-stc/defining-technical-communication/) as any form of communication that exhibits *one or more* of these qualities:

+ Communicating about technical or specialized topics, such as computer applications, medical procedures, or environmental regulations.

+ Communicating by using technology, such as web pages, help files, or social media sites.

+ Providing instructions about how to do something, regardless of how technical the task is or even if technology is used to create or distribute that communication.

If your "How To" does any one of these things, again, you're on the right track.
