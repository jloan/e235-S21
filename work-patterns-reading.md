## Assignment Overview?Purpose

This quarter we will be using a tool called Hypothes.is to engage readings using various forms of annotation.

To get started, we are going to read and annotate William Hart-Davidson's "What are the Changing Patterns of Work in Technical Communication?" Weâ€™ll annotate this using Hypothes.is (in Canvas). I like this reading as a starting point for thinking about technical communication. I think this reading will help frame the the kind of writing projects we will do this quarter and offer us some ways to talk about them.

## What is an annotation?

In this context, an annotation is a note made in the margins of the texts we will read together. These marginal notes will be used to identify important points and ideas, pose and answer questions, make connections to our experiences and other knowledge, and to have conversations with the reading.

## What should I annotate?

For this reading, our first experiment with what we'll call *social annotation*, our goal is to build upon our responses to the question "What is technical writing anyway?" that is the focus of one of our discussions this week.

In relation to our discussion work, annotations might be in any of the following areas:

+ Identify an important idea or point in the reading. In your annotation -- say why you think this is important.
+ Identify a place in the reading where you have a question. In your annotation -- pose your question and offer an initial attempt at an answer.
+ Identify a point in the reading where you can make a connection to something -- this might be another reading or something in your own experience.
+ Respond to someone else's annotation. Engage another reader in conversation about something they have annotated. For example, if someone poses a question you might have some into possible answers/perspectives.

## How Many Annotations Should I Add?

This will vary from reading to reading I imagine, but let's use this as an initial guide:

+ Each student contributes at least 3 original annotations to the text. Work to spread your annotations out over the whole reading.
+ Additionally, each student responds to at least 2 annotations originally made by a peer.

## Hypothes.is Help

When you click on the link below to open the reading, you'll find some support documentation (or a "How To" on using Hypothes.is). Use this example of tech writing to help you get started.
